# Roadmap

## Backlog

- **GPS module support** — Integrate with OpenWrt's default GPS package for hardware-based positioning. Required for BeaconDB contribution (reference positions).
- **Location history on map** — Show a location trail on the Overview map by pulling stored history from a configured tracker (e.g. Traccar, OwnTracks).
